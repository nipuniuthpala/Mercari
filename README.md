Mercari UI Test folder contains Test/Base/Steps/XCUIElemnts folders to structure the code.

 Test folder contains the two tests in BDD approach.
 
 Base folder conatains the functions for app loanch and teardown the app in each test.
 
 Steps folder contains all the functions to click and assert the elemnts.
 
 XCUIElemnts folder contains all the elements with identifiers. since I cant downlaod the app or web login to locate the elements I have mentioned them as identifiers 0,1 and so on.
